# Banking on Customer Growth
## Unsupervised Learning Models for Bank Customer Clusterization

Across the state of California there is no shortage of financial banking institutions. Californians have well over 200 banks to choose from when shopping for financial products. Many banks use monetary incentives or gifts to lure new deposit account customers. However, a deposit account serves only as the foundation upon which the bank can develop a relationship with customers. Customers with single product relationships are more prone to being lured away by other bank bonuses. A key in customer retention is to develop a relationship with clients by serving as more than just a place to keep deposit accounts. Credit cards, mortgages, securities, certificates of deposits, online banking, and personal loans are all products often referred to in the industry as “sticky products.” The more “sticky products” a customer has, the more likely they are to remain with the bank. This unsupervised learning project will cluster a sample of 5,000 customers and conduct an analysis of each cluster’s characteristics and their corresponding banking relationships.

The dataset used in this study pertains to an unamed bank in California. The dataset includes a combination of discrete and continuous variables to characterize customers and provides information of the products each customer has with the bank.

The goal is to leverage the insight from the analysis to develop more efficient marketing campaigns focused on deepening client relationships and improving client retention.
